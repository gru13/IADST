# Specifications of Schemas

Hereâ€™s your **complete, corrected, and optimized schema** for **MongoDB (NoSQL)** only.

## ðŸŸ© **MongoDB Collections**

MongoDB is used for storing all data, including course-student mappings, assignment details, question and solution content. All backend logic is implemented in Java Spring Boot.

- `teachers` collection: Stores teacher details. (Created by Admin)
- `students` collection: Stores student details. (Created by Admin)
- `courses` collection: Stores course details, including teacher, students, and assignments. (Created by Admin; teacher and students are assigned to courses by Admin)
- `assignments` collection: Stores assignment metadata, difficulty distribution, and per-student assigned questions.
- `questionTexts` collection: Stores the actual question content.
- `solutionTexts` collection: Stores the actual solution content.

Data Flow:
- Admin creates teachers, students, and courses (all documents in MongoDB).
- Admin assigns teacher and students to courses (updates `courses.teacherId` and `courses.students` array in MongoDB).
- Teachers create questions and assignments (documents in `questionTexts` and `assignments`).
- Assignments are linked to students and questions in MongoDB.
- Questions and solutions have all metadata and content in MongoDB.
- Students are assigned assignments and questions via MongoDB collections.

All relationships are managed via ObjectId references between collections. No SQL/relational tables are used. All CRUD and lookup operations are performed on MongoDB collections only.
